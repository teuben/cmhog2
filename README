This is 'cmhog', revision 2 (cmhog2). A PPM code to simulate the 2D gas
flow in a barred galaxy. It is based on the code Piner, Stone and Teuben
published in their 1995 (ApJ 449, 508) article.

Although the code stands alone, it is useful to have the MIRIAD, and
especially, NEMO package around. See hydro.tex in the documentation
tree for suggestions how to use the code.

Some of the tools may be reproduced in $NEMO/src/image/hdf/cmhog, although
we attempt to keep the two synchronized

Updates:

September 2002:
    piner94.src can now initialize an internal grid for testing
	 $pgrid $ 
    is needed in cmhogin. 
    a potential on a grid can now be read in, and gas   (TODO)

April 2003:
    piner94.src : added vhalo,rhalo to  /pgrid/

May 2011:
    Kim et al. (2011) paper report a sign error in the bar component
    of the azimuthal force.
    gfortran need $end at the end of each line in the 'cmhogin' file.
    


Known problems:

- numeric grid potential from barred potential not stable enough
