This is 'cmhog', revision 2 (cmhog2). A PPM code to simulate the 2D gas
flow in a barred galaxy. It is based on the code Piner, Stone and Teuben
published in their 1995 (ApJ xxx,yyy) article.

Although the code stands alone, it is useful to have the MIRIAD, and
especially, NEMO package around. See hydro.tex in the documentation
tree for suggestions how to use the code.
