This is 'cmhog', revision 2 (cmhog2). A PPM code to simulate the 2D gas
flow in a barred galaxy. It is based on the code Piner, Stone and Teuben
published in their 1995 (ApJ 449, 508) article.

Although the code stands alone, it is useful to have the MIRIAD, and
especially, NEMO package around. See hydro.tex in the documentation
tree for suggestions how to use the code with these utilities.

Some of the tools may be reproduced in $NEMO/src/image/hdf/cmhog, although
we attempt to keep the two synchronized

Updates:

September 2002:
    piner94.src can now initialize an internal grid for testing
	 $pgrid $ 
    is needed in cmhogin. 
    a potential on a grid can now be read in, and gas   (TODO)

April 2003:
    piner94.src : added vhalo,rhalo to  /pgrid/

May 2011:
    - Kim et al. (2011) paper report a sign error in the bar component
      of the azimuthal force.
      Equally so, the bar was placed along the X axis, not the Y axis
      as was intended.
      This unfortuitous combination of errors made the hydro flow 
      look just about right....

    - gfortran needs $end at the end of each line in the 'cmhogin' file.
      It is possible this still works with g77.

    - we keep two variables, hardcoded, that can be tweeked back to the
      pre-2011 version of the code:

      	       signerr = 1          (in galaxy.src)
	       balongy = .FALSE.    (in piner94.src)

Known problems:

- numeric grid potential from barred potential not stable enough
  (could this also be related to the azimuthal force issue?)
